# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the latest minor release of x402-mcp with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

Only the current 0.1.x line receives security patches. Older pre-release or untagged commits are unsupported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open public GitHub issues or pull requests for security vulnerabilities.**

### Preferred Reporting Channels

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (recommended if enabled for this repository): Use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the Security tab.
2. **Email**: Send a detailed report to `kwizzlesurp10@gmail.com` with the subject line `[SECURITY] x402-mcp`.

Include as much detail as possible:
- Description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (PoC if available)
- Affected versions / commit SHA
- Suggested remediation (optional)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receipt
- **Status updates**: At least every 7 days while the report is under investigation
- **Resolution target**: Critical issues within 14 days; high/medium within 30 days where feasible

### What to Expect

- **Accepted**: We will confirm the issue, develop and test a fix, coordinate disclosure timing with you, and credit you in the advisory / release notes if you wish (anonymous reporting is fully supported).
- **Declined**: We will provide a clear explanation (e.g., not reproducible, out of scope, already fixed, or accepted risk). You may request a second review.

### Scope Notes

This policy covers the x402-mcp codebase, its dependencies as used in the project, the seller storefront endpoints, payment verification/settlement paths, quota and Redis stores, and the operator dashboard. Issues in upstream x402 SDKs, Coinbase CDP, or third-party facilitators should be reported to their respective maintainers; we will still assist in triage when relevant.

Thank you for helping keep x402-mcp and the agent commerce ecosystem secure.
